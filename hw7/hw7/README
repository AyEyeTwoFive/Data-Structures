Part A:
    AVL Tree Testing: I first wanted to test each of the possible types of rotations in the simplest way possible. The
    4 main rotation types are left and right single rotations, and left-right or right-left double rotation. Thus, I
    created 4 tests cases for each of these by simply inserting the keys one, two, and three in different orders to
    test the different rotation types as follows: 1) one, two, three for left rotation, 2) three, two, one for right
    rotation, 3) three, one, two for LR rotation, and 4) one, three, two for RL rotation. These are illustrated below:

    1.    1                                   2
           \                                 / \
             2       ------------>          1   3
              \       left rotation
               3         of 1

    2.       3
            /                              2
           2     ------------->           / \
          /     right rotation           1   3
         1         of 3

    3.    3                               3
         /                               /
        1       ------------->          2        -------------->          2
         \      left rotation          /         right rotation          / \
          2          of 1             1              of 3               1   3

    4.    1                            1
           \                            \
            2    ------------->          2        -------------->          2
           /     right rotation           \         left rotation         / \
          3          of 2                  3          of 1               1   3
